		<TD><big><strong>MS - Preparing for the Test</strong></big>
			<P>The right time to start preparing for the exams is the beginning of the third year. Be prepared to write the exam by the end of the fifth semester. Believe it or not, one needs at least 4-5 months <i>real</i> preparation and we think the best time to spend some time for the same will be fifth semester or the beginning of the sixth semester.If one is planning to write the exam seriously <i>(which one should, otherwise he or she will just be wasting money!)</i>, please work hard and do some dedicated religious preparation since there is a lot of money at stake (around 50000 rupees). We hope to throw some light into some of the basic things like the pattern of the test, useful books et al.</P>

			<P>The test consists of a verbal section (works out tough for normal Indian students), analytical section (this needs some practice and hands-on) and a quantitative section (easier than our tenth standard maths – no compromise less than 100% in this section). The recommended books are <UL>

		<p>Please don’t feel ashamed to mug the full Barrons word list as this is some thing that is mandatory for getting a score above 2100 that is highly recommended under the present circumstances to get admission into a good school. On an average, a good score can be anything above 2100. As far as the final marks are concerned, there is always a factor of luck on that day of exam. But the most important factor is the hard work and regular preparation. Also, there are people who have the habit of keeping flash cards with them. Learning the words in the flash cards everyday helps us a lot in writing the verbal section of GRE exam.</p>
		<P>Analytical section is a really challenging one; this is one section where the practice helps a lot. The general pattern of questions in the analytical section is the same every time. So it’s mostly a matter of getting familiarized with the pattern so that one does not waste time understanding the question. As one does practice exams, keep a note of the score and one will notice a gradually increasing pattern of scores in all sections. Typically, many of us start with around 1800 and by the end of 4-5 months (assuming that word list mugging goes on well!), if one have written around 20 practice tests, one’s score should be around 2100+. It may be a good idea to write the actual GRE test after one are able to score around 2100 in one’s practice tests. Also, please do practice sessions of computerized GRE. Though contents are the same, the manner in which they ask questions is different.

		<P>One doesn’t need to pursue a hectic preparation, as one has to do for GRE. TOEFL exam is comparatively easy. But one does need some preparation as well as practice for the exam. But a preparation of two weeks will be good enough for the same. A minimum score of 600 is recommended, as some schools demand this score as the minimum qualification for application. In fact the TOEFL and GRE scores counts a lot while applying for teaching assistantships and other jobs inside the campus.
