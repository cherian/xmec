WWWAdmin is finally here!  I know it used to be a pain to have to maintain 
WWWBoard without a program, so I am currently developing WWWAdmin.  Right 
now it performs the basic functions, which allow you to remove messages and 
change your password.  I will explain each different process and how to set
up this program below.  I will also list some of the features you can expect
in upcoming releases.

The variables and options in WWWAdmin should correspond directly to those in 
WWWBoard.  In all except two cases, you can copy the variables out of 
wwwboard.pl and place them in wwwadmin.pl.  There is one new variable in 
wwwadmin.pl and one variable that will need to be changed:

	$cgi_url = "http://your.host.xxx/cgi-bin/wwwadmin.pl";
		This variable needs to be changed from the url to 
	   wwwboard.pl to the url to wwwadmin.pl.  This may simply mean 
	   changing the file name at the end of the url.

	$passwd_file = "passwd.txt";
		This is a new variable and simply gives the filename of the 
	   password file in relation to $basedir.  So if you place this 
	   file in $basedir, you can simply set this variable equal to the 
	   filename, which is most commonly passwd.txt
____________________________________________________________________________

RUNNING WWWADMIN.
	WWWAdmin is a self-contained script, in that all you have to do is 
   call the script with a plain url (The url you used in $cgi_url) and it 
   will give you a form which displays all of your options.  The options 
   that are currently available in this release are:
	Remove Messages
	Remove Messages by Date
	Remove Messages by Author
	Remove Messages by Sorted Number
	Change WWWAdmin Password

All of these options require you to use a password and username once you 
take the link.  The default username and password for WWWAdmin are:

Username: WebAdmin
Password: WebBoard

They are case sensitive, so make sure you type them in correctly.  I suggest 
you jump down to the explanation on Changing WWWAdmin Password before 
you make this wwwboard available to the public.  A brief description of 
how each WWWAdmin function works is below:

REMOVE MESSAGES
===============
	When selecting this link, you will be taken to a form which gives you 
the article number, two radio boxes, the subject, author and date that 
the article was posted, for all articles.  The form is put inside of a 
Netscape table, but I have tested it and it also works with lynx (a text 
based browser) so I am sure it will work with others.  You can check the 
radio boxes to the side of the messages that you wish to remove from 
your WWWBoard.  Checking the check box to the left, will remove the 
entire thread, while checking the check box on the right, simply removes 
that single posting, whether it is imbeded in a thread or not.  This 
will also remove the message out of your messages/ directory, and if you 
select to remove the thread, it will remove all messages in that thread 
out of your messages/ directory.

REMOVE MESSAGES BY DATE
=======================
	This link will pop up a form that looks something like this:

  Checkbox   Date1   # of Messages  Message Numbers

You can click in the checkbox next to any dates of your choice and it 
will remove all files that were posted on that date.  To see what files 
are going to be removed and how many, you can look at the columns 
labeled # of messages and message numbers.  If messages of an earlier 
date happen to be at the head of a thread, they will be removed and the 
next response down in the thread becomes the head of that thread.  It 
will only remove messages with that date.

REMOVE MESSAGES BY AUTHOR
=========================
	This link will pop up a form very similar to that which the Remove 
Message by Date link brought up.  Except instead of different dates, you 
will see the names of authors of messages.  You can check the checkbox 
next to an authors name to remove all postings that he or she posted to 
your message board.

REMOVE MESSAGES BY SORTED NUMBER
================================
	This link brings up a form identical to the plain Remove Messages form, 
except that the postings are sorted from lowest number to highest 
number.  This can be useful if you want to delete postings in the order 
they were posted, but this is probably the l east useful remove function.

CHANGE PASSWORD
===============
	This form will ask you to fill in your current username and password 
and allow you to change your username and password to whatever you 
like.  If you want to keep the username the same, you can simply not 
fill in the 'New Username' part of the script.  When changing your 
password, which I suggest you do right when you get WWWAdmin working, 
you will need to type the new password two times in a row, just to make 
sure you don't mis-type it.  Then, hit submit and if you input the 
correct old username and password, you will be given a response that 
tells you the new username and password.  Do not forget your password, 
because it will be encrypted in the passwd.txt file, just like your Unix 
login password.  You will need to re-download the wwwadmin tool...
__________________________________________________________________________

FUTURE FEATURES
===============
	I will continue to work on this admin tool and hopefully make it much 
more powerful.  To do this, I need to know what you would like to be 
able to do with it.  Some of my ideas include being able to edit any 
post, and possibly moving them around in hierarchies.  Let me know what 
else you would like to see this thing do.
