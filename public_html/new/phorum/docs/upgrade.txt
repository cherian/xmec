Upgrade instructions for Phorum 3.3

3.2.x and 3.1.x
----------------

Place the files in a new directory on your web server.  The standard
install process will allow you to upgrade your database tables.

You will however need to review your Phorum Setup options in the admin
once you have the install done.  Some changes in the Phorum internals,
in addition to new fields in those options, made it unreliable to import
these from the old config file.

This covers things like HTML Settings, Global Options, etc.


3.0.x
------

The upgrade30.php script is currently located in the scripts/ folder.
It must be run from a subdirectory of the main Phorum installation,
and you should remove it from your server after the upgrade is done.

1. Install Phorum as per install.txt.
2. Copy forums.inf from your old location to another location
3. Modify the variable $oldinfpath in upgrade30.php to point to
   the location that you placed the copy of forums.inf
4. Comment out all the $DB lines in the old forums.inf by
   placing a // at the beginning of each line.  e.g.:
//   $DB = new db();
5. Comment out the $q lines.
6. Comment out the include lines.
7. Run upgrade30.php from a browser.
8. Load the admin script for your new installation and select:
   Rebuild INF File
9. In the same area, select:
   Reset Main Sequence
