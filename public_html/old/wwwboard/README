WWWBoard is the Version 2.0 of my Bulletin Board Message System.  I think 
that the name is much better, and a lot fewer characters.  Version 2.0 
has many enhancements, which were never put into version 1.0.  MANY of 
the bugs in version 1.0 were fixed, although I am sure you will probably 
find more.  

This version of the message system is a complete re-write over the last 
one, and is not at all backwards compatible.  To use this new version, 
you will just need to remove all past messages and start again.  I think 
it is definitely worth it.

WWWBoard Version 2.0 has managed to reduce the number of scripts required 
to run the bulletin board from three down t one.  This makes it much more 
efficient.

The following files should have come with WWWBoard Version 2.0 ALPHA 2:

        a.  ALPHA-2       - READ THIS.
	1.  README	  - The necessary Install Instructions.  This file.
	2.  wwwboard.pl   - The Perl CGI script that runs everything.
	3.  wwwboard.html - The HTML WWWBoard file that users will see.
	4.  faq.html	  - An FAQ file displayed for users of wwwboard.
	5.  data.txt	  - Where the file number is stored.
	6.  messages/	  - Where the messages will be created and stored.
	7.  wwwadmin.pl	  - An Admin tool to delete messages.
	8.  passwd.txt    - The encoded password and username for WWWAdmin
        9.  ADMIN_README  - WWWAdmin README file.

You will need to edit by hand several of the files that come with 
WWWBoard Version 2.0.  Below is a description of how to modify all of the 
necessary files:
___________________________________________________________________________

				WWWBOARD.PL
				===========

This file must be placed in your server's cgi-bin, or if your server has 
.cgi extensions allowed, you can simply rename this file to wwwboard.cgi, 
changing the $cgi_url variable below to reflect this.  The file must also 
be chmoded 755. Ask your system administrator for more information on 
either the cgi-bin or chmod command.

This is the most complicated file you will need to modify.  It comes with 
a lot of variables and many options.  Below is a summary of how to 
configure all of the variables and what the options do:

###########################################################################
# Define Variables

$basedir = "/path/to/wwwboard";
	This variable should contain the absolute system path to your 	
        wwwboard directory.  So if you keep all of your files in 	
        /home/yourname/public_html and you make a directory under there
        called 'wwwboard', then $basedir would be set to: 
        /home/yourname/public_html/wwwboard.

$baseurl = "http://your.host.xxx/wwwboard";
        This is the base URL to the directory where wwwboard is kept.  So
 	staying with the example above, if your main directory is called 
        by: http://your.host.xxx/~yourname/, the $baseurl would be set to: 
        http://your.host.xxx/~yourname/wwwboard/.

$cgi_url = "http://your.host.xxx/cgi-bin/wwwboard.pl";
	This is the URL that points to wwwboard.pl.  This will be used in 
        followup form responses, so this must be correct.

$mesgdir = "messages";
	This is the name of your messages directory which will be appended
 	to $basedir.  All of the messages for wwwboard will be created and
 	held in this directory.

$datafile = "data.txt";
	This is the name of the data file which will also be appended to 
        $basedir.  It will hold the current filename count, and the script 
        will read this in and determine the message filename from this 	file.

$mesgfile = "wwwboard.html";
	This is the name of the wwwboard.html file, which you might want to
 	rename to index.html for the sake of a shorter URL.  It will be 
        appended to both $basedir and $baseurl to determine the URL and the 
        absolute path to this file, both for URL references by the script 
        and for editing of this file by the script.

$faqfile = "faq.html";
	This is the path to the faq.html file which will be appended to 
        $baseurl so users can find their way to the Frequently Asked
 	Questions file about WWWBoard.

$ext = "html";
	This is the ext with which all individual files will be created 
        with.  Most of the time it should be left as html, but on the 
	occasion when you may be suing this on a dos based platform you can
 	switch it to 'htm'.

$date_command = "/bin/date";
	This needs to be the path to your 'date' command.  This script uses
 	the date command to time stamp the messages individually with along
 	date and to place a short 'added' date on the wwwboard.html page.

$title = "WWWBoard Version 2.0 Test";
	This is the title of your WWWBoard, which will be used on the 
        individual message pages.  Call your message board whatever you 
        like, but I do recommend changing the above to something a little 
        more catchy. :-)

# Done
###########################################################################

There are also several options you will need to configure:

###########################################################################
# Configure Options

$show_faq = 1;          # 1 - YES; 0 = NO
	This option allows you to choose whether or not you want to display
 	a link to the FAQ on every individual message page or not.  It
 	defaults to 1 and the link will be put in at the top of the message
 	along with links to Followups, Post Followup and Back to $title.
  	Setting this to 0 will turn it off, and keeping it at 1 will keep
 	the link.

$allow_html = 1;        # 1 = YES; 0 = NO
	This option lets you choose whether or not you want to allow HTML 
	mark-up in your posts.  If you do not want to allow it, then
 	everything that a user submits that has <>'s around it will be cut 
	out of the message.  Setting this option to '1' will allow HTML in 
	the posts and you can turn this option off by setting it to '0'.

$quote_text = 1;        # 1 = YES; 0 = NO
	By keeping this option set to 1, the previous message will be 
	quoted in the followup text input box.  The quoted text will have a 
	':' placed in front of it so you can distinguish what had been said 
	in the previous posts from what the current poster is trying to get 
	across.  Setting this option to '0' will leave the followup text 
	box empty for the new poster.

$subject_line = 0;      # 0 = Quote Subject Editable; 1 = Quote Subject
                        #   UnEditable; 2 = Don't Quote Subject, Editable.
	There are three options for the way that you can display the 
	subject line for the user posting a followup.  Leaving this option 
	at '0' which is the default value, will put the previous subject 
	line into the followup form and allow users to edit the subject 
	however they like.  Setting this option to '1', however, will quote 
	the subject, but simply display it to the user, not allowing him or 
	her to edit the subject line.  The third and final option can be 
	achieved by setting the $subject_line variable to '2'.  If it is 
	set to '2' the subject will not be quoted and instead the user will 
	be prompted with an empty subject block in their followup subject 
	line.

$use_time = 1;		# 1 = YES; 0 = NO
	This option allows you to choose whether or not you want to use the
 	hour:minute:second time with the day/month/year time on the main 
	page.  Day/Month/Year will automatically be placed on the main 
	wwwboard.html page when a new entry is added, but if you leave this 
	variable at '1' the hour:minute:second time will also be put there. 
	This is very useful for message boards that get a lot of posts, 
	but if you would like to save space on your main page, you can set 
	this to '0' causing the hour:minute:second display not to be added.

# Done
###########################################################################

WOW!  You made it through all that.  That was the hardest file to edit.

___________________________________________________________________________

			   WWWBOARD.HTML
			   =============

wwwboard.html must be placed in the directory that you defined in 
$basedir of your wwwboard.pl file.  It must be chmoded 777 so that your 
web server's uid (User ID) has permission to write to this file.

This file needs much less editing than the wwwboard.pl script.  There are 
three things that you will want to edit in this file.  The first two are 
simply the title of your WWWBoard.  Currently the two lines look like:

<title>WWWBoard Version 2.0!</title> and <h1>WWWBoard Version 2.0!</h1>

You will want to change the title and header "WWWBoard Version 2.0!" to 
whatever you want to call your WWWBoard.  This should probably be the 
same as the variable $title that you defined in wwwboard.pl.

The third line in this file that you will need to edit is the one that 
looks like:

<form method=POST action="http://your.host.xxx/cgi-bin/wwwboard.pl">

You need to change the URL that is in action="" to the same URL that you 
defined in wwwboard.pl as $cgi_url.

Once you have made these changes you can exit this file and save it.

___________________________________________________________________________

			 	FAQ.HTML
			 	========

This file does not need to be edited, unless you want to change the 
heading or title or add a link back to your wwwboard page.

It should be placed in the $basedir directory and its name should reflect 
that of the $faq_file variable defined in wwwboard.pl

It should be chmoded 744, so that it is readable by all.

___________________________________________________________________________

			       MESSAGES/
			       =========

This is a directory that should also be placed in $basedir as defined in 
wwwboard.pl.  This directory must be chmoded 777 so that messages can be 
written into it by the server's UID.

___________________________________________________________________________

				DATA.TXT
				========

Simply place this file into $basedir as defined in wwwboard.pl and chmod 
it 777 so that the web server can write an incremented number to it.  
This is where the file name number will be kept.

___________________________________________________________________________

				 README
				 ======

		    This is the easiest.  Just READ it!

___________________________________________________________________________

Version 2.0 Improvements Over 1.0:

* HTML does not mess up postings like the last version did.
* There are many more options to allow flexibility in design.
* One CGI program instead of three.  Makes everything smoother and
  more efficient.
* File names are derived from an incremented number up to 99999 so that
  messages won't overlap, like they could have with the old pid numbers that
  were used.
* Many more things I can't even begin to list.

Version History:

Version 2.0:		Complete Re-Write of Version 1.0
	11/4 	-	ALPHA 1 Version Released because many people were 
			writing asking if they could get a copy of it.
___________________________________________________________________________

As with all of my scripts which you can find at my scripts archive:

http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/

These are provided at no charge.  You can modify/edit/change/anything you 
want to these scripts.  There are only two things that I ask, neither of 
which will you be sued for if you don't follow.  :-)

1)  Please let me know where these are being used  I like to see my work in
    action.  you can let me know simply by filling out the on-line from
    located at:	   http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/implement.html
2)  Please keep my name somewhere in the script. It doesn't have to be
    noticeable to users, but I appreciate it being in the script somewhere 
    in case you ever pass it on or anything like that.
3)  Oh yah, there's a third one, but its the one I care least about.  I 
    know how many people like to keep everyone at their own site and  
    therefore do not link to the outside too often, but if at all possible, 
    I would appreciate a link to my scripts archive.  Once again, this 
    isn't necessary.
4)  Do the rules ever stop you say?  This last one is easy to follow:
  			***HAVE FUN!***
