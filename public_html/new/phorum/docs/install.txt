1. Uncompressing the file
--------------------------

Since this file in in the package you most likely already have done this.

Once you have downloaded the file you need to uncompress it.  If you got the
zip file, you probably are on Windows and know how to do it.  For those on
*nix who may have downloaded one of the tar packages, consult the tar man page
for specifics.  A quick explination for the different ones is:

for phorum-3.x.tar.gz:
> tar -xzf phorum-3.x.tar.gz

for phorum-3.x.tar.bz2:
> tar -xIf phorum-3.x.tar.bz2

Once you are done you should have a directory called phorum-3.x.  Switch to it
and read ahead.


2. Securing the settings and admin
------------------------------------

a) What and Why

Before I tell you what to do, let me explain why you need to do it. There
are two people you need to protect your file from: people on your server and
people outside your server.

 - Virtual (shared) Sites

If you have a dedicated server you don't need to read this part.  If you have
a virtually hosted web site, also known as shared hosting, there are other
people that have a login for the server your files are on.  These people could
in theory read your files using either their shell login or a PHP, Perl or
other script they write.  Hopefully they won't but they might.

The best way to protect yourself in this case is to use a hosting service that
allows you full control over your Apache configuration and allows you to run
the web server under your username.  This way all the files can be owned by
you and only your user can access them.

Next would be finding a host that uses the safe mode feature of PHP.  This
feature will restrict access to files based on the username of the executing
script.  This will protect you against others writing PHP scripts to crack
your files.

Hosts can also use what is known as SQL safe mode.  This means that the
database connection does not take a user name or password.  Instead, it reads
the user name of the file executing the script and uses it to connect.  This
means that only files you create can access your database.

Another good method for protecting your PHP files is to wrap your scripts with
a tool like CGIWrap <http://cgiwrap.unixtools.org/>.  This topic however goes
beyond the scope of this document and more into server adminstration.

One good thing to remember is that if someone on your server is getting into
your files, you need to report them and if you are using an upstanding host,
that user will be kicked off.

 - Web Protection

The other concern is users on the web seeing your settings by requesting them
in a browser.  This is not a big a deal as it first sounds.  All the files in
Phorum are parsed by the PHP engine.  This means that when they are requested
they are parsed and the output, not the contents are sent to the browser.

This could be a problem if the file extension your host uses for PHP is not
the same as what Phorum is using.  However, the full name of the settings file
can be changed in common.php.

Having said that, there is no real good reason to leave your configuration
files where they could be requested from the web.  We reccomend moving the
settings dir to a location that is not under your web directory (often called
www, htdocs or public_html).

You can optionally also tell the web server not to server pages from certain
directories.  With Apache this is done with the Deny directive.


b) Using the bash script to secure Phorum.

If you look in the scripts directory of your Phorum installation you will find
a file called 'secure'.  You can run this file by switching to the Phorum base
directory and running the script like:

> bash scripts/secure

The script will ask you a few questions and then move your files, set the
permissions on the files and directories and can also add .htaccess files
where they can help.  If you have a system where you can use bash I reccomend
doing this.


c) Doing it by hand.

If you don't have access to bash there is still hope.  Nothing that script
does cannot be done the old fashioned way.  Here are the basic steps you need
to take to achieve the same thing the script does.

    1) Move the admin/settings dir outside the web tree.

        eg. When you log in to your web server, you are put into your home
        directory.  Lets say it is /home/foo.  In that directory there is
        another dir called htdocs.  htdocs is where all of your web files
        live.  What you will want to do is create a dir in /home/foo called
        phorum_settings.  You will then need to set the permissions on this
        dir to allow the web server to write to it.  On most servers this
        means giving read, write and execute access to the world (public).
        Some server have the web server running as the same group as the
        users.  If you know this is the case or setting the world permissions
        does not work for you, try setting the group permissions to read,
        write and exec.

        Once you have the permissions set, copy or move the existing
        forums.php file from admin/settings to /home/foo/phorum_settings.  You
        will also need to set the permissions on this file.  Allow read and
        write access to either group or world depending on your server set up.

        The last thing here is to change the variable at the top of common.php
        to point to the new directory.  By default it looks like this:

          $settings_dir="./admin/settings";  // no ending slash

        You would change it to look like this:

          $settings_dir="/home/foo/phorum_settings";  // no ending slash

    2) Rename the admin directory.

        One of the simplest things you can do to keep people from trying to
        hack into your admin is rename it.  Simply change the name.  Make it
        something silly like your dog's name.  Phorum will adapt.

    3) Use the web servers security.

        Your web server should have the ability to block access to a directory
        or file.  For Apache this is done by use the Deny directive such as:

        Deny from all

        If that was put in a .htaccess file or inside a Directory directive in
        httpd.conf (you may not have access to httpd.conf) no files from that
        directory would be served.  You can do this for every directory in
        Phorum accept images and admin.


3. Running the install script
------------------------------

Now that the files are ready, run the install script.  Point your web browser
at your admin where ever you put it.  The admin knows that the install is in
progress and will ask you some questions.  It is pretty self explanitory.

Once the install process is done, click the link to go the admin and login
using the username and password you provided to the install script.


4. Using attachments (file uploads)
------------------------------------

If you want to allow your users to upload files to your server along with
their posts there are a couple of extra things you need to do.

    1) Create a directory where the attachments will be stored.

        You might want to create a directory such has /home/foo/attachments.
        You will need to set the permissions on this directory the same as you
        did the settings one as Phorum will need to write to it.

    2) Go to the admin and set your Attachment Settings.


5. Assigning moderators
------------------------

Phorum now allows for multiple moderators per forum.  Using the User Admin,
you can allow users who have created a profile using the register.php to be
moderators.  When they log in to the admin they will be sent to a moderator
page where they will only have access to moderation tools.  Also, when they
are logged into the forums, links to edit or delete posts will appear with
each message.

The forums have to be created and the user has to have a profile before this
can happen.


6. Getting Help
----------------

If you still can not get Phorum installed, come to http://phorum.org/support/
