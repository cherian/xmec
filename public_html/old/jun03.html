		<TD><big><strong>JUNE 3<sup>rd</sup> MEET - Bangalore Chapter - REPORT <BR> <BR> 
(as presented by Chapter President Manu Sreenivasan to the Executive Commitee)</strong></big>
			<P>Dear members of the executive committee, <BR><BR>
			 
			The executive committee might be aware of the formation of the Bangalore chapter of the Alumni Association of MEC on June 3rd, 2001, which was attended by around 100 members. A working committee was nominated on that day with one member from each batch (year). The following persons were nominated to form the working committee for the Bangalore chapter: <BR><BR>
			 
			1. Manu Sreenivasan (1993) - Subsequently was nominated as the President of the chapter. <BR>
			2. Rajesh Bhaskar (1996) <BR>
			3. Ramesh Shanmugam(1997) <BR>
			4. David Mathew (1998) <BR>
			5. Robi Thomas (1999) <BR>  
			6. Shyam Bhaskara Menon (2000) <BR><BR>
			(There was no representation from 1994 and 1995 batches, and the working committee has been authorized to nominate one person each from 1994 and 1995 batches into the committee). <BR><BR>
			 
			As per the existing alumni association bylaw, since the executive committee needs to authorize the formation of the local chapters, I, on the behalf of the working committee of the bangalore chapter take this opportunity to communicate officially about the formation of the chapter. <BR><BR>
						 
			To talk briefly about the meeting held on June 3rd, it was good gathering, where many members talked about various issues and ideas with passion, and finally we could relive our college days with some lively music (by members) and dancing. The working committee met subsequently to consolidate all the discussion points to be presented to the executive committee of our alumni association. <BR><BR> 
			<strong>Section 1 :</strong> Discussion points / Proposed Action items from the meeting on June 3rd, 2001 
			 <BR><BR>
			 
			1. Alumni Website + Database - <BR>
			<P> We as a forum strongly felt that we need to maintain a common platform for networking where each alumni member can register, track fellow members' information, college news and activities etc. In today's networked world, an alumni website would be most effective in doing so. <BR><BR>
			We believe some initiate has been taken by some members to get the requirements drafted and have some estimates made. We request the executive committee to consider this matter with due importance and expedite the implementation of this. <BR><BR>
			2. Bylaws - <BR>
			Many members felt that there is a need to have a relook at the existing bylaws, and to streamline the Vision/Mission/Goals/Objectives. <BR><BR>
			The following are some of the suggestions by members/working committee:<BR>
			Amendment to the "Duties and Powers of the Committee" section: To increase the Quorum required to 6 or to retain it as 4 with an additional clause saying "excluding the staff representatives" <BR>
			Mandatory representation by representatives of others chapters (Bangalore, Chennai etc.) in the AGM (need to look at the feasibility of it). <BR>
			Representation of Alumni in Senate - Many members felt that this could be a step in the direction to providing inputs relating to syllabus updation etc. (again need to look into the feasibility of it) <BR>
			Discussion on the name of the alumni association also came up. This came out mainly due to the fact that unofficially the members know each other as "Members of XMEC" than AAMEC. <BR><BR>
			3. Career Services - <BR>
			We felt that one of the key values alumni can provide to MEC is to provide career guidance for students, serve as the interface for fresh job seekers, provide guidance in project/seminar works, act as "Mentor" for a group of students to provide insight into real life situations/issues in organizations. <BR>
			Many members also felt that with a common platform like website in place, this could be mostly done online. <BR>
			Play our part in updating the college students with the latest industry trends through technical seminars and skill development workshops. <BR><BR>
			4. Funds - <BR>
			Enough was spoken about this in the meeting, but the point I would like to make on behalf of the Bangalore chapter is that, there is strong need to bring in transparency to the whole system. Even though Sageer could give us a rough idea about the fund position, it would be great if the executive committee could take the initiative to publish the source and use of funds in the standard/statutory format. This would help in putting to rest most of the mud slinging and sarcasm surrounding the issue of usage of funds. <BR>
			We respect the decisions taken by the executive committee on previous occassions and it is in good faith is that we are requesting the committee to bring in the much needed transparency. <BR><BR>
			5. Scholarships/Assistance - <BR>
			Many members felt the need to help the needy and brilliant students. The suggestion was to keep aside a portion of the alumni fees collected each year to be earmarked as fixed fund, which can be used to fund scholarship(s) for the needy and brilliant students. <BR>
			Suggestions about providing funds for purchase of books to the college library also came up in the meeting.<BR><BR>
			 
			<strong>Section 2 :</strong> Charter for the Bangalore Chapter<BR><BR>
			 
			As part of the activities of Bangalore chapter, the working committee has come out with a charter, outlining the broad spectrum of activities we plan to take up in the next one year. <BR><BR>
			 
			1. Bylaw and organization Structure - <BR>
			Working committee has volunteered to act as the single point contact for any alumni related activities in Bangalore, and hence we request the executive committee to communicate with anyone of us or to xmec_bangalore@yahoogroups.com (will reach all the working committee members) for the same. <BR>
			We deliberated in detail about the need to have separate bylaws (derived mostly from the overall alumni bylaw). No conclusion has been made on this, and the executive committee's inputs would be valuable to us in this direction. <BR>
			Working committee would meet once in a month to discuss the activities in progress/to be undertaken. <BR>
			Working committee would request volunteers for various activities that are planned to be undertaken (e.g Newsletter editor). <BR><BR>
			2. Funds - <BR>
			One of the reason for thinking about a separate bylaw and probably registration (we are yet to get clarification about the legal issues) was the need to have some amount of local funds. This would be used for chapter specific activities and towards MEC/alumni as decided by the working committee. <BR>
			We have roughly chalked out the sources and uses of funds based on the activities planned for the year, and have promised all the chapter members to be as transparent as possible in this matter. <BR>
			The details about the funding aspects would be finalized soon and would be made available to all the chapter members. <BR>
			The accounts of all the events conducted by the Bangalore chapter would also be made available to the members after each event. <BR><BR>
			3. Chapter Specific Activities - <BR>
			Most of our energy would be focused on networking with a good mix of fun. <BR>
			Lot of focus would be on conducting frequent get-togethers especially on social occasions wherein alumni members would be able to fulfil the purpose of getting to know each other (typically 1 meeting per quarter). <BR>
			A Newsletter for the chapter to keep us up-to-date about the happenings in the chapter and also the industry. <BR><BR>
			4. Career Services - <BR>
			Many members have shown active interest in providing support to the existing students in terms of updating the MEC students with the latest industry trends through technical seminars and skill development workshops. <BR>
			All possible help in providing placement assistance would be provided by the Bangalore chapter. There are some members in the Bangalore chapter who are part of recruitment teams in many reputed organizations, who are the best ambassadors of MEC. <BR>
			We hope that the executive committee would look into each of the above items in the right spirit and would take it forward in the best interest of the alumni and the college. To conclude this mail, on behalf of the Bangalore chapter of alumni association of MEC, the working committee assure our full support to the alumni association and we look forward to see a truly great alumni association which would....Inspire lifelong loyalty and pride among alumni by strengthening their continued relation with MEC in every way. <BR><BR>
			 
			Thanks and regards, <BR>
