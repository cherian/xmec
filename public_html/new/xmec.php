  	<P class=body>XMEC is the abbreviation for exMECians, the Alumni Association of Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara, Kochi. XMEC is an autonomous body representing eight hundred or more engineers who have earned their degrees in Model Engineering College. It binds together MECians who are spread out in institutions and industries around the globe. The backbone of XMEC is the relentless support and cooperation of all exMECians who live in India and abroad and who are proud to announce "MEC made me what I'm today”. </P>
  	<P class=body>The alumni of Model Engineering College have always had fond memories of the life in MEC. The alumni proudly accept the reality that today exMECians are associated with virtually every conceivable technology that will drive tomorrow's world, as Software Programmers, System Analysts, Web developers, ASIC Designers, Hardware Engineers, Research Scientists, Biomedical Engineers, Business Executives, Technical & Business Managers and Academicians. </P>
  	<P class=body>Yesterday wouldn’t have been easy for many, fresh out of college, if not for all the support showered by senior XMECians. XMEC aims to serve as a bridge for budding engineers from Model Engineering College, and elsewhere, to cross over into this competitive world outside. </P>
  	<P class=body>XMEC represents everything that is endearing about MEC. Be it the camaraderie, the bonhomie, the adventure, the joy… It represents commitment – to the alma mater, to the staff, to the present students… It also represents a vision - of an excellent, dynamic, vibrant, exciting institution; a nation’s pride. </P>
  	<P class=body><B><I>It takes a braveheart to introspect. To look back into one’s college life, to seek better avenues for those still there, to transform the very essence of a place where they belong only in memories. </I></B></P>
