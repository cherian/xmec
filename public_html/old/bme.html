		<P>Biomedical engineers may be called upon to design instruments and devices, to bring together knowledge from many sources to develop new procedures, or to carry out research to acquire knowledge needed to solve new problems. Students choose to pursue advanced studies in the field of biomedical engineering (BME) to be of service to people; for the excitement of working with living systems; and to apply advanced technology to the complexproblems of medical care.</P>
		<P>There are more than 80 college and university programs in BME in the United States alone. Among the best graduate schools for BME, Johns Hopkins University, MIT, UCSD, Duke University and University of Washington top the list. Some of the well established specialty areas within the field of BME are bioinstrumentation, biomechanics, biomaterials, systems physiology, clinical engineering, and rehabilitation engineering.</P>

		<LI>Designing and constructing cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators, artificial kidneys, blood oxygenators, hearts, blood vessels, joints, arms, and legs.</LI>
		<LI>Designing computer systems to monitor patients during surgery or in intensive care, or to monitor healthy persons in unusual environments, such as astronauts in space or underwater divers at great depth.</LI>
		<LI>Designing and building sensors to measure blood chemistry, such as potassium, sodium, 02, CO2, and pH.</LI>
		<LI>Designing instruments and devices for therapeutic uses, such as a laser system for eye surgery or a device for automated delivery of insulin.</LI>
		<LI>Developing strategies for clinical decision-making based on expert systems and artificial intelligence, such as a computer-based system for selecting seat cushions for paralyzed patients or for, managing the care of patients with severe burns or for diagnosing diseases.</LI>
		<LI>Designing clinical laboratories and other units within the hospital and health care delivery system that utilize advanced technology.</LI>
		<LI>Designing, building and investigating medical imaging systems based on X-rays (computer assisted tomography), isotopes (position emission tomography), magnetic fields (magnetic resonance imaging), ultrasound, or newer modalities.</LI>
		<LI>Constructing and implementing mathematical/computer models of physiological systems.</LI>
		<LI>Designing and constructing biomaterials and determining the mechanical, transport, and biocompatibility properties of implantable artificial materials.</LI>
		<LI>Implementing new diagnostic procedures, especially those requiring engineering analyses to determine parameters that are not directly accessible to measurements, such as in the lungs or heart.</LI>
		<LI>Investigating the biomechanics of injury and wound healing.</LI>
		<LI>Exploring the various aspects of biotechnology from the engineer's perspective.</LI>
