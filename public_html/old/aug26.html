		<TD><big><strong>AUGUST 26<sup>th</sup> MEET - US West Coast - REPORT </strong></big>
			<P>The first gathering of XMEC Alumni in the US west coast was held at Lake Elizebeth, Fremont, CA on 26th August,2001. The turnout was an excellant stimulant, to say the least, 41 adults or about 90% of the total crowd, and it was a pleasure to see most of the faces after a long time! The main attraction of the agenda being lunch, we had a sumptuous "OnaSadhya" with Avial, Sambar, Rasam, Olan, Elissery, Cabbage thoran, Pappad, curd and 3-4 varieties of Payasam! The meeting was reminiscent of the ancient Gurukul tradition, under a tree, and all of us introduced ourselves to the group. Faisal and Robi briefed about various Alumni activities as a whole and Robi gave a detailed talk on the problems faced by the college (students). Most of the members expressed their concerns, while offering their whole hearted support and guidance to the students in prospective career decisions. An executive committee has been formed to deal with the future activites of the chapter.
