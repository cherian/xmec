  	<P class=body>Introduction</P>
<P class=body>Though I thoroughly enjoy the role as moderator, sometimes, I have a tough time deciding which mails I should let through and which I should not. The group has a lot "hi" mails, "joke" mails, "porn" mails, "virus" mails, "repeat" mails, mails from "head hunters", etc. In short, I have a lot of mails to be moderated and what you see/get are half of what is sent to the group. Though in recent days, the number of mails from xmecians, rejected is not too many (Hope I did not speak too soon <img src="images/smiley.gif">).</P>
<P class=body>Different people in the group have different preferences, different opinions. I have to make difficult decisions. Difficult because they have to be unbiased, which is a problem. 'Tis human to be biased'.</P>
<P class=body>My philosophy is that, a mail, which you receive, can always be deleted, but a mail, which you do not receive, you do not get to see. Personally I would rather delete a mail rather than to miss out on anything. But then there might be others who would be of the opposite opinion and not to forget, those who have trouble accessing their mail remotely.</P>
<P class=body>Content of the Mails</P>
<P class=body>Relevance: The mail has to be related in some way to MEC/xmecians.<BR>
Batch Info: All mails are to have the name and batch (such as CE93-97) mentioned alongside. If they are not present, the sender will be asked to resend the original mail with the details (unless very urgent). Applies to Staff and Placement Cell as well.<BR>
Attachments: Make the mail as light as possible. Please do refrain from sending attachments. Attempt to do the following instead (in order of priority):
Paste the contents of the attachment (difficult only if contents are jpegs, gifs, etc.) inside the body of the mail.
Attachments (if big and needs to be sent, such as wedding invites) may be uploaded in the site <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xmec/files/Miscellaneous/>, which is accessible to all members of xmec group and then the link should be specified in your mail.
If the attachment is mandatory, try to put the highlights/gist of the attachment in the body of the mail itself (so that people have to bother to check the attachments through the web, only if they are keen to do so.
Also note, those who choose Daily Digest or No Mail / Web Only option will not receive Attachments with the mail. So please try to make sure the content is present in the text of the mail as much as possible.<BR>
Forward Requests: Do not send mails to me asking me to forward unless, you have very valid reasons. You are expected to send your mails directly to xmec@yahoogroups.com / xmec-jobs@yahoogroups.com.<BR>
Forwards info: Please avoid long chains of forwards and the forwarded information present in certain mails. (Caution you to check as much as possible about the authenticity of the mail before you decide to forward to the group)<BR>
Scope: XMEC-Jobs is for xmecians only (unless otherwise specified). DO NOT forward mails outside the group. If you wish to share the info, YOU must send the resume of your relative/friend to the xmecian who has made the job posting. When doing so, mention your relationship with the candidate being referred by you and also your roll number!!<BR>
HR info: Remove the HR details, which may be present in the mail sent by your HR. I don't think the HR personnel of your organization should be bothered by anyone, and would advise anyone best approach you instead. Also remove all the referral procedures (meant for you, the employee) and mention the actions to be taken by the xmecian who would like to apply to the posting.<BR>
HR Consultants: Avoid mails from Headhunters as much as possible. At the max, send a mail introducing them and their contact details. So that if any xmecian in interested, he/she may contact them (Instead of any xmecian being bothered by the head hunters).<BR>
Privacy Statement: To anyone who may enquire contact details about any xmecian (s), please respect the privacy of xmecians and do not disclose the information without prior permission. Please respond, "If you have something to offer to xmecians, it may be communicated to them using our group and anyone who is interested may respond to you using your contact details mentioned in your information sent to the group." Xmecians are not to share information about other xmecians to "strangers", unless you know for sure that the xmecians will not mind the same. Also, always keep the xmecian informed.<BR>
Etiquette Details: Please provide details in your first mail itself, leaving no element of misunderstanding possible and ensure that they are unambiguous, decreasing chances for need of follow up mails.<BR>
Subject: Attempt to have the subject of the mail relevant to the content and helpful to the recipients, such as company name or post in job postings. (Example: Fresher Openings - Baan - Hyd - 25th June 2004)<BR>
Conflict Resolution: Avoid direct attacking/provoking/sarcastic remarks to other xmecians. Attempt to resolve issues directly with the original sender and then send out a common mail with corrections, detailing, if any (though I do admit this is not always possible).<BR>
One-Liners: Please refrain from sending one-line comments in response to other mails as much as possible.<BR>
I will be restraining very few mails from xmecians directly, as I feel that xmecians are responsible enough to know what mails they should send to the whole group and what not.<BR>
Procedure adopted for mails related to contacting xmecians:First I see if I have their ID or if it is present in http://www.xmec.net, and then send a reply to the sender and the missing xmecian, awaiting a reply.
If the above is not successful (that is when the 'missing' xmecian does not respond), then attempts are made with other batch members who I may be in touch with.
Each xmecian's information in http://www.xmec.net needs to be kept up-to date for this reason.
If the search is urgent, as may be indicated by the sender, then I will let it through immediately.</P>



<P>Job Related Mails<BR>
Any job related mail must be sent to xmec-jobs@yahoogroups.com. Mails from HR Consultants are numerous and one may join other job related groups to receive those mails.
Resumes must not be sent to the group and must be sent to the mail id specified in the ad or as per instructions in the mail sent.
Specifying batch details such as CE93-97 while signing off is mandatory in xmec-jobs as well.My basis is to let in career related mails to xmec-jobs when:<BR>

Sent from xmecians directly only.
Assuming that the referral from the xmecian will/might have an advantage in the selection procedure of the candidate, or
Assuming that the xmecian might benefit from the referral bonus that he stands to gain. (We would like to help our xmecians, wouldn't we?)
Delays:
Will attempt to avoid delays in letting through mails to the group (moderation) as much as possible, but please forgive me in certain circumstances. When I am on vacation, there will usually be a delay of a day max.

If any mails are URGENT and you don't find that your mail has come to the xmec group, please send me a message to +91 94402 36395.

Accessing XMEC Mail:
Yahoogroups provide a variety of options for message delivery, which one may change at anytime at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xmec/members:



Individual Emails
Messages are delivered one at a time to one's email inbox. This is the best option if one wants to keep up on the latest posts immediately. Email attachments, if included in a message, will be sent directly.



Daily Digest
Messages are delivered in batches of 25 or daily, whichever comes sooner. This is the best option if one wants to receive fewer mail messages and do not need up-to-the minute posts in one's inbox. Email attachments are not available in digests.



Only Special Announcements
This means one will receive email messages only when the group moderator posts a "Special Announcement" message. This option may be used if one wants to pass on day-to-day discussion for very busy groups but do want to receive important updates from the group moderator. This feature is not very useful in our group, as we do not use this feature extensively as yet. Not recommended.



No Mail / Web Only
This option puts email message delivery on hold, for example while one is on vacation. This option permits one to read messages at the site http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xmec/messages.



Please note that you can link various email ids to a yahoo account to avail of most of the above facilities. For this, go to http://groups.yahoo.com/memwiz and use the Membership Wizard.



Subscription Tip:

The Membership Wizard (http://groups.yahoo.com/memwiz) allows you to link one or more of your email ids to one yahoo id (which you use to login to yahoogroups). By doing this, you can send mails from any of those ids to any of the yahoogroups you are subscribed to (using various email ids). At the same time, you will receive the yahoogroups mails only in the email account with which you have subscribed to a particular group.



Suggest all are members of xmec-jobs as well, so that at any time, you may post messages, even though you may not want to receive mails in this group. So, please choose your delivery option accordingly.

<P class=body>This centre of learning is a role model to all the other professional colleges in the state in terms of student discipline and order. Students of the college adhere to a uniform dress code, perhaps a unique first time in the history of any professional college in the state. This has helped create oneness and camaraderie among the students.<BR><BR>  </P>
