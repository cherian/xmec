		<TD><P class=name><strong><center>Long History of Credit</center></strong></P>
		<P class=body>Just as Rome was not built in a day, the idea for an alumni website did not take shape out of the blue. It has been an arduous journey through the long dark tunnel before it finally saw the proverbial light of day. www.xmec.net would never have been possible but for all the support of XMECians, MECians and faculty. </P>
		<P class=body>The following names are fondly remembered, for the very existence of this venture...</P>
		<P class=head><img src="images/medal.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Start</strong></P>
		<P class=body>Sibiraj.B and Anoop A.. for their words of motivation and inspiration </P>
		<P class=head><img src="images/medal.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Network Team</strong><BR>
		<P class=body>The process of acquiring and authenticating roll numbers, names and email IDs was a herculian task, to say the least,  since MEC did not have a college alumni database in place.  Credits for creating the validated list go out to Ms. Vijayalakshmi, Mohammed Sageer, Diya Das, Ashish Jose & Arun Paul Alex. A special word of thanks to Prof.Jyothi John and Prof.Jacob Thomas for their support. At the end of a truly collective affair, the compilation of the preliminary lists drew an overwhelming response from all the classes. Credits go out to the following...  Any names left out is purely inadvertent. <UL>
