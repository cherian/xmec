			<P><i>It was just another day of leisure for the rest of Chennai…but that fine morn spelt a new dawn for the XMECian Chennai chapter. The crowd of one or two which had gathered at 11 for the much-awaited trip to MGM, a private beach resort 22kms off the hue and cry of the city, grew to a creditable 32 by noon and the spirited gang set out on their journey to togetherness.Even the important few from Bangalore, Mr. Preethish Kumar, Mr.Nishanth Peethambaran and Mr.Krishan B. joined us to show that wherever we are the feeling of oneness would still persist.</i></P>
			<P><i>On reaching the destined resort, enthusiasm running high and the thrill still going strong, the crowd shared their latest news taking in every scene in all its beauty. The official meeting commenced with a few moments spent in silent prayer. In the absence of the General secretary Mr. Prinu Shaan Nazeem, Mr. Rahulan A M of batch 2000, convened the meeting. </i></P>
