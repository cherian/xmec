		<P class=body><i>'Privilege entails responsibilty'</i>. XMEC is solemnly aware of its responsibilities to humanity, and the society we live in. We live in a world where poverty, ignorance and calamities are a reality. Most of us have been blessed by the Almighty with a career and life in comfort. Every action of compassion shown will bring joy and happiness into the lives of many a downtrodden, bed-ridden and wronged. Each one of us can make a difference to the world we live in. <i>In this Walk of Life, let us stop by to help those who have stumbled, fallen and lost their way, those who are yet to Walk</i>.</P>
