		<TD><big><strong>SEPTEMBER 21<sup>th</sup> MEET - US East Coast - REPORT </strong></big>
			<P>The second gathering of the East Coast chapter of XMEC was held in New Jersey on 21th of September, 2002. A report on the day that passed by in the words of Joby Babu EE (94-98) </P>
			<P><i>MEC alumni get-togethers here at the US east coast have always been about taking a break from the monotony of everyday routine. This year was no different as technocrats from the East Coast chapter spanning from Maine to Florida, Jersey to Milwaukee, got together on the 21st September, 2002.</i></P>
			<P><i>The sprawling Johnson's Park at the peripheries of the Rutger's University campus, New Jersey played host as 31 prodigies from the great institution, along with kith and kin, spent a relaxing, stress-free day of mirth and laughter, revisiting the past and reliving momories. It was a phenomenal day with fun and games, warming up with a round of crunching cricket and culminating in a sevens football clash, with plenty of authentic mallu food washed down with beer and wine, and above all, a no-holds-barred 'Kathi' session.</i></P>
			<P><i>New Jersey held top honours for maximum attendees followed closely by Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York. The program was kicked off at midday (though the invite card said 11 am, we had to stick to MECian tradition<img src="images/smiley.jpg"> and extended well into the evening. Though the deterrants were aplenty -  xmecians in the region are separated by more than 700 miles - people took great pains to make it for the occasion and had more than their share's worth.</i></P>
			<P><i>On a serious note, a small meeting was conveyed to discuss about the chapter activities. An opinion voiced by many members was to spread awareness of the East Coast Chapter, especially among newer alumni who are coming to the region for work/higher studies.  We are a well-knit and networked community spread across quite a large region, and it will be our pleasure to do whatever we can to all those who are flying to the east coast.</i></P>
			<P><i>There is a member database already in place in yahoogroups, and the time is just right for new members in the region to sign up at <A href="mailto:xmec_east-owner@yahoogroups.com"class=slink >xmec_east@yahoogroups.com</A>.</i></P>
