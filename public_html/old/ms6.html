<TD valign=top><P><strong>MS - Assistantship</strong></P><BR>
<P>This will be <i><strong>the topic of interest</i></strong> for almost all those who are interested in applying for MS. Always keep in mind that there is an earlier application deadline for financial aid in almost all the schools. So make sure to send the financial aid application and the general application pretty much in advance before this deadline. Some schools might be lenient in the time deadlines, but most of them are not. Also there will be a big crowd waiting for the financial assistance. So one has to be on time for this.</P>
<P>Also start emailing the professors in one's area of specialization even before applying to the schools. So if some professor agrees to give an assistantship or is interested, one can apply to that school after that. But normally these professors' get too many emails that most of them get deleted immediately. However, one should not be disappointed by all this and should contact Professors as mush as possible. Also if one has some industry experience in the area of specialization one is planning, give special emphasis to that while trying to get in touch with the professors. Please go through the college web site and talk to alumni, students and department administrators to get an idea about the professors who have enormous amounts of money with them.</P>

The teaching job can be in other departments also like Physics, Chemistry, Maths etc</P>
