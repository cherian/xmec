      <p class="western" align="justify">As much as I&#8217;m happy that yet another
 novel venture from X-MEC is slowly taking shape, I sincerely regret the
amount  of time taken to make this first edition of X-MEC newsletter a reality.
Although  I can give umpteen number of reasons for us not being able to give
our full  attention to this newsletter, eventually all what counts is whether
we were  able to or not. And we were not able to give X-MEC this newsletter
on time.  And I do, accept the responsibility and apologize for this very
long delay.</p>
               
      <div align="justify"> </div>
               
      <p class="western" align="justify">I do feel that this venture by X-MEC
 is a particularly laudable one and it is for we, x-MECians, to make this
a success. The newsletter should serve as a platform for anything and everything
 that an X-MECian would want to share or convey. It is up to the X-MECian
fraternity to help release this newsletter on a regular basis, so that this
would become yet another feather in the illustrious cap of XMEC. Although
we couldn&#8217;t incorporate everything we had hoped to in this newsletter, I
feel that if some more of you can come forward and devote a little more time
to this small venture, then we can, slowly make this worthwhile. We would
 sincerely like some more of you to provide a few more articles, which could
go a long way in guaranteeing that our newsletter is released on time, with
enough quality. Please, please make it a point to devote some time (a few
hours will do) every few months, and compile something, which you can contribute
to your newsletter. Without your support and cooperation, all this effort
will go futile.</p>
               
      <div align="justify"> </div>
               
      <p class="western" align="justify">I have always been a proud MEC-ian.
 Right from the day of joining that prestigious institution, till date, I
believe that the institution has given me a lot. In a way, I would also say
 that &#8220;MEC made me what I&#8217;m today&#8221; and my college days were &#8220;the best days
of my life&#8221;, for sure. But there&#8217;s no such thing as free lunch. If each of
us could spare some time and write on a sheet of paper the name of persons
to whom we are obliged in some way or other, i.e. the name of persons who
have helped us in our life, who have helped us develop our personality, our
attitude, our skills, our behavior, ourselves, I can assure you (and I&#8217;ve
done this), the list would be much much longer than you think. It could go
on and on, and it should. Now if you could write on another sheet, the name
of persons to whom you have been an inspiration, to whom you&#8217;ve been of worth,
to whom you&#8217;ve been of at least some value, believe me, you&#8217;ll have to think
long and hard to get at least a few names on that sheet. Ok, you guys may
not be &#8220;worse&#8221; like me, and would get quite a few names in the other column,
but the point I wanted to make is that all of us, each and every one of us,
owe a lot, owe a lot to the society, owe a lot to the individuals who helped
develop us, owe a lot to the institution which helped harness our skills.
We have received so much from the society and it&#8217;s our duty to give back
at least a little. How we should do that is for each one of us to decide.

      <p class="western" align="justify">In this fast moving life, its only
 natural that we lose ourselves in the rapid pace. In fact, the most common
 word I&#8217;ve heard since coming to Bangalore, and of course the one I&#8217;ve most 
 often used also, is that &#8220;I&#8217;m busy, I have no time to spare&#8221;. Like it or
 not, this is how our life is and I believe, would be. But the onus is on
us. Think of making a difference in someone else&#8217;s life, believe that you
can make a difference and you certainly will be remembered. We all can.</p>

 country</b></p>

      <p class="western" align="justify">America is a fascinatingly large
 country. A cultural kaleidoscope of 280 million people, home to Whites,
Blacks,  Asian, Indian, Jew, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,
Hawaiian,  Pacific Islander, Mexican, Latino, Hispanic, European, Arabic,
Persian and  combinations of the above races thereof. (Here Indian denotes
the broad envelope  of races that include the American-Indian or the Red
Indian as we know them,  the Indian-American who is American by birth and
preference but Indian by  skin and descent and of course the regular Indian,
by taste and looks.).  This is the land of the Statue of Liberty and the
Grand Canyon, of Martin  Luther King and Mohammed Ali, the land of the best
research and the finest  universities, of more Nobel Prize winners than the
rest of the world put together. Yeh hai America Meri Jaan.  </p>
               
      <div align="justify"> </div>
               
      <p class="western" align="justify">America is the ultimate haven for
 dreamers. It is a land of the self-made man. It is here that some of the
biggest breakthroughs in science unfolded. The country that etched the biggest
success stories in the history of all mankind, where college dropouts and
psychedelics reached iconic role model statures. America is a curious country.
A great land but curious all the same. Here people go to school after attending
college; you wouldn&#8217;t go into the restroom to take rest. A busy signal is
not in a traffic junction at rush hour but in a telephone. Gas is not filled
in cylinders in the kitchen but in cars. Here you can not only pay your bills
by check but also pay your check by cash. A hood is not only in the rhymes
of gangsta&#8217; rap but also in the front of your car. A flash is by no means
an obscene gesture but just a torch. The list goes on. You get the picture.</p>
               
      <div align="justify"> </div>
               
      <p class="western" align="justify">Sometimes I wonder if the entire
 nation is built upon the unyielding backbone of attitude and individuality.
 For an American, there is no further truth than the supreme sense and pride 
 of being an American. Right from when he is born, every human being here
 is constantly reminded and reinforced by his peers and teachers and parents
 and friends and the media that the greatest thing he ever accomplished in
 life was to have been born into this great country. It is a privilege that
 the lesser mortals of the netherworld were not privy to. Now don&#8217;t get me
 wrong and think that I am an anti-nationalist or xenophobe. Some of my best
 friends in this country are Americans; they are some of the nicest people
 around, extremely courteous folks who go out of the way to make you feel
at home. But to this day, the curious phenomenon of the fabled American way
of life never ceases to perplex me.  </p>
               
      <div align="justify"> </div>
               
      <p class="western" align="justify">Another benchmark crucial to the
 American dude is &#8216;space&#8217;. Not the never-ending continuum of the cosmos,
but  the sense of personal and physical being akin to a tiger&#8217;s personal
territory;  which is uniquely his own and only his own. Everyone is entitled
to his &#8216;space&#8217;.  While it is not uncommon for two people to talk at a spit&#8217;s
throw from each  other in India (and giving each other an oral shower in
the process) the American always keeps his distance. The one arm distance
rule is not just in the military. Only the closest confidante or lover has
the right to breach this territory. For the same reason, one can imagine
the look on the face  of the normal John Doe as two Indian langottiya-yaars
walk past him with each other&#8217;s hands-on-shoulder. Mutual respect of each
other&#8217;s space is what defines cool. Some of my yank buddies would go, &#8220;Why
are you guys so touchy-feely? &#8221; Now, how I convinced them that not every
Indian walking hand-on-shoulder with his best friend is a flagrant homosexual
is an effort I will spare you the details of.  </p>
               
      <div align="justify"> </div>
               
      <p class="western" align="justify">I read this book called the &#8216;Notes
 from a Big Country&#8217;, which is probably the funniest book I have read on
the  American way of life. I highly recommend it for any one who appreciates 
a hearty laugh.  The book is filled with innumerable absolutely meaningless
 statistics and inane information unique to America and American behavior.
 And at the end of it, whether it was when you learned that Americans take
 their car wherever they go; even if it's only a block down the street, or
 how everyone is happy to sue each other on basically no grounds at all,
for  no reason or every reason; it provides you countless laugh-out-loud
moments.   </p>

      <p class="western" align="justify">If you are one for tickling the
funny bone, another treasure not to be missed is a title called Bush Aphorisms
&#8211; a meticulously chronicled essay of President Bush&#8217;s attempts at speeches
while in office. People the world over enjoyed the humor inlaid in the bloopers.
 Only if Mr. President himself realized they were jokes.  </p>

      <p class="western">As the saying goes, All that ends well is well.
As we come closer and closer to the release of this first X-MECian newsletter,
 this would remain incomplete, if I were not to thank some persons who have
 been immensely involved in this venture. Without their selfless service,
this would never have materialized.</p>
                 
      <p class="western">As always, our very own Vyas has been a constant 
 source of inspiration and motivation (to put in his own words, he is the
 one pincher in the whole of X-MEC). A huge kudos has to go to Prakash Ramachandran
 (CS 94-98), who single handedly did all the designing work. Next time around,
 I feel, some of you ought to voluntarily come forward and help him in the
 designing part. Please contribute your little bit in making this a better
 newsletter.  </p>
                 
      <p class="western">Also heartfelt gratitude to Sandeep Unni, Anaz and 
 Manod Jose for providing the much sought after &#8220;articles&#8221;. I would also like
to thank Sanish Suresh and Amal Chandran for the tips and support they provided.<br>
