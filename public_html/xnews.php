<P class=body><img src="images/dot1.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;XMECian co-authors book on Teletraffic Modeling...
<BR><img src="images/MBNTM.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Murali Krishna P has co-authored a book, <i>Multifractal Based Network Traffic Modeling</i> along with Vikram M. Gadre and Uday B. Desai. The book provides an overview of existing broadband traffic modeling based on the Poisson process and its variants like the MM1 models. It also provides very good coverage of models based on self-similar processes. Throughout the book, the authors have focused on the problem of broadband traffic modeling keeping in mind long range dependencies in broadband traffic.<BR><BR>"<i>Concerned with communication networks rather than delivery trucks, Krishna, Vikram M. Gadre, and Uday B. Desai (all electrical engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay) address the problem of broadband traffic modeling by using multiplicative cascade processes, which were originally developed to study phenomena relating to turbulence. They present a new model, the Variable Variance Gaussian Multiplier, which takes into account the nature of variation of the multiplier distributions used to generate the multiplicative cascade process.</i>" says the Book Inc in its editorial review. <BR><BR> Murali Krishna P grauduated with B.Tech Degree in Electronics Engineering from MEC in the year 1996 (4<sup>th</sup> Batch). He went on to do his MTech and PhD at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. He currently works at NPOL, Kochi( a DRDO Laboratory).
