<P><strong><img src="images/letter.gif"><font face=arial size=-1 color="#669999">The Chemistry of Communication</font></strong></P>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Introduction</big><BR>For those who feel fascinated by the word 'chemistry', it is indeed a pleasure to look at the title and form our own views about the topic. The intention here is to analyze communication technology, by looking at the arrangement of different domains in it, as reflected by the term ‘chemistry’ in the title. The word chemistry itself may force some of the Tech. readers to desist from going through the document. Let me put this as an excuse for not going to the real 'History' of communication, as an engineer's acquaintance with history ends much before chemistry. One may find encyclopaedias on the above mentioned. This document is not aimed at a specialist in communication, but at a general technical observer, who works in associated fields.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Communication Core</big></A><BR>By communication core, the physical layer technologies involved in communication are meant. As per the earlier general classification of core technologies there are two classes, Analog and Digital communication systems. This segregation was rendered invalid by the marriage of these technologies and the offspings thereof, doesn't solely belong to any of the parental religions. But inorder to exploit the 'Divide and Rule' policy, one can forcefully classify them as wireless and wireline technologies. These two are also moving towards convergence to produce a synergy. The evolution here is very much analogous to the anatomy of our cardio vascular system. The high capacity Optical veins carry the bulk of the information blood, which is spread across living cells(end-users) by a mesh of 'wireless' capilaries.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Anatomy of Wireless</big><BR>I will try to give a brief idea of the happenings in the wireless world. One may be quite familiar with the jargons doing rounds like 3G, 4G, CDMA, GSM etc. GSM is implemented using the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and was pioneered by European telecommunication companies. GSM is the front-runner among the second-generation (2G) wireless technologies. IS-95 standard, deployed in the United Stated used Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). There
were lots of hype that CDMA could achieve capacities of the order of 10 times that of TDMA. As the technology was implemented, it was seen that the improvements may be below a factor of 3 and further more, in some scenarios the gain achieved was just around one.</P><BR>
<P>The crave for achieving multimedia communication over mobile systems, regional politics, big fishes in the industry, patent borders and lot of associated factors, gave birth to a new child called 3G. I too am looking for its father! 3G predominantly uses WCDMA (there are provisions to be compatible with other technologies too), which is a wideband version of the original CDMA. Political pressures might have forced an early split in the 3G community into two different groups, but we hope that they will settle the affairs without a divorce. Now, if you feel that 3G is not enough, or you were left out of the race in 3G technologies, there is an alternate option. Dream about 4G!</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>The Network</big></A><BR>While the physical layer was full of bull fighting, it is the network, which has made frog-leaps. The advances in routing technologies, marriage with new technologies like MPLS, gradual induction of IPV6 into the network and above all, standards like TCP/IP 'pillar'ing as defacto ones based on which stable network architectures can be built: reasons go this way for such a solemn growth. A special mention should be given to the maturing of optical technologies going all the way upto the network layer. People now a days are implementing (talking?), light(lambda) switching and perhaps routing too in optical domain(hype?). Let us hope for a day when light delivers packet all the way to the application address.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Signal Processing World</big></A><BR>Many of the parallel advances in the above mentioned technologies were brought into light by signal processing technologies. I will just mention a few sentences about this. There are real experts in our group, who have agreed to write skilled drafts. Estimation, Detection and Adaptation, this trinity has transformed the signal-processing world of communication. This is very much true especially with the receiving systems, the shape that you see today. Those handheld (finger held) devices in your hand, whatsoever the make are, mostly employs a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) core, which runs an algorithm implementing the trinity mentioned above. Signal Processing was also quite successful in bringing juice back into communication using copperwires and coaxial cables, through DSL and cable modems. A careful reader may note that the transmission technologies are left out here. This is simply because, from a signal processing perspective, all that is done special at the transmitter can be viewed as a preprocessing for efficient estimation, detection and adaptation.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>World of Entropy</big></A><BR>The communication world of entropy is a little older than half a century. The brainchild of C.E.Shannon, who even after his death, wields a profound influence on the way things evolve here. Explanation of information theory may not be appreciated by some of the readers, who may have read just a Taub and Schilling chapter in the 90s. Just to mention, mathematics, stochastics, logistics and communication blends here in the right proportion for a real (wo)man who wants to learn communication and do research in it. Many a times information theoritical bounds acted as catalysts in the development of communication 'reactions'.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Digging further Deep</big><BR>How long one will keep screwing the same old Silicon. This
element of the last century, seems to have infinite depth from an engineering perspective. Am largely ignorant about the developments there, but quite sure about the stellar role it played in the evolution of communication. Experts in that area are invited to shed some light. Communication inside the chip should have all the fascinating contents of physics and mathematics. Even at a slightly higher level, the linking of different chips and their communication at the information consumption rate achieved today, poses a multitude of technical challenges.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Looking Ahead</big></A><BR>Perhaps the most pursued area of activity today is wireless networks, or adhoc networks, to stay with the jargon. Stunning results from the academia gave this area a pessimistic tint, but industry is all set to go ahead. With a symbiosis of standards and technolgies like Bluetooth, WLAN, Infrared etc, the bigwigs of the industry are preparing the hook. It will not be long before the marketing earthworms attached to the hook coax the consumer fish. Not to be called an 'anti-globalist', let me wish them `Happy Fishing'.</P><BR>
<P><img src="images/pen.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>Winding Up(Down)</big><BR>We presume that many among the readers have already acquired a command over their respective fields and play pivotal roles in the developments there. Those may feel that their areas are omitted in the sequel. I admit my ignorance to that effect, but a good number of topics form articles of itself, much bigger than this. We will be glad to get enlightened by short articles or even comments from the experts, as your time permits. </P><BR>
